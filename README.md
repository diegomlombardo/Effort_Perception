Portions of this code were developed with assistance from ChatGPT (OpenAI). The AI was used to help to refine code, but all outputs were reviewed and edited by the author to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.

This repository contains the analysis code for the study titled "Trait-like neural signatures of physical effort perception dissociated from motor execution in humans", led by Diego Lombardo and supervised by Florian Monjo. The study explores the relationship between brain activity and perceived effort. The scripts (Model_Control_task and Model_Experimental_task) load fMRI data from a group of participants, using Perceived Effort Scores (PES) as input. They extract the average BOLD signal from predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and perform linear regression analyses to predict perceived effort while controlling for head motion. The pipeline includes outlier removal, permutation testing to assess statistical significance, and Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Additionally, the analysis computes partial Spearman correlations to assess the unique contribution of each ROI, controlling for other ROIs and motion artifacts. High-quality visualizations with shaded confidence intervals are generated to illustrate the results. These regression and partial correlation analyses correspond to Figure 1, Figure 2, and Table 1 in the Results section of the manuscript. To use these codes fist has to be uploaded the file " behavioral_fMRIFD_data.mat" containing for 44 subjects framewise displacement in fMRI (head movement) and PES scores form original data bases
