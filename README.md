Portions of this code were developed with assistance from ChatGPT (OpenAI). The AI was used to help to refine code, but all outputs were reviewed and edited by the author to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.

This repository contains the analysis code for the study titled "Trait-like neural signatures of physical effort perception dissociated from motor execution in humans", led by Diego Lombardo and supervised by Florian Monjo. The study explores the relationship between brain activity and perceived effort. The scripts (Model_Control_task and Model_Experimental_task) load fMRI data from a group of participants, using Perceived Effort Scores (PES) as input. They extract the average BOLD signal from predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and perform linear regression analyses to predict perceived effort while controlling for head motion. The pipeline includes outlier removal, permutation testing to assess statistical significance, and Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Additionally, the analysis computes partial Spearman correlations to assess the unique contribution of each ROI, controlling for other ROIs and motion artifacts. High-quality visualizations with shaded confidence intervals are generated to illustrate the results. These regression and partial correlation analyses correspond to Figure 1, Figure 2, and Table 1 in the Results section of the manuscript. To use these codes fist has to be uploaded the file " behavioral_fMRIFD_data.mat" containing for 44 subjects framewise displacement in fMRI (head movement) and PES scores form original data bases

This script "Effect_sizes" computes the effect size (Cohen’s f²) for each brain region of interest (ROI) used as a predictor in a multiple linear regression model. The model predicts a behavioral outcome based on BOLD activity from different ROI groups, while controlling for head motion. For each ROI group, the script calculates how much variance in the outcome is uniquely explained by that group, by comparing the R² of the full model (including all predictors) with the R² of a reduced model where that specific ROI group is removed. Head motion is kept in both the full and reduced models to control for confounding effects. The result is a set of f² values that quantify the individual contribution of each ROI group to the model.

This " Table_S1" R script processes a master Excel dataset to prepare and summarize participant data across three physical activity groups: Sedentary, Average, and Sportif. It loads relevant libraries, cleans and converts variables (including PES and MVC) to proper numeric formats, and applies descriptive labels to key behavioral and neuroimaging measures. Finally, it generates a Table 1 summary using the table1 package, presenting group-wise statistics for age, head motion (FD), perceived effort, muscle strength (MVC), and task-based fMRI BOLD responses across several brain regions for both control and ischemia conditions.
